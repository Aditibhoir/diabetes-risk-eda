# Diabetes Risk Analysis - EDA Project

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on **Diabetes Risk Prediction**, completed as part of the internship task at **Global Next Consulting India Pvt. Ltd. (GNCIPL)**.

> **Project Title:** Diabetes Risk Analysis using EDA  
> **Author:** Aditi Bhoir  
> **Internship:** GNCIPL (Leader in Consulting)  
> **Dataset Source:** [PIMA Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)

## 📊 Project Overview

This project performs a detailed exploratory analysis of a diabetes dataset, highlighting patterns, trends, and key risk factors associated with diabetes. It includes the use of data cleaning, correlation heatmaps, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `diabetes.csv` – Cleaned dataset used for analysis  
- `Diabetes_Risk_Analysis_EDA_GNCIPL_Aditi.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with all EDA steps  
- README.md 

---

## 🔍 Key EDA Techniques Used

- 📌 **Missing Value Handling**
- 📌 **Histograms & Boxplots** (feature distributions & outliers)
- 📌 **Heatmaps** (correlation analysis)
- 📌 **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** – dimensionality reduction
- 📌 **KMeans Clustering** – exploratory segmentation of patient types
- 📌 **Outcome-based Comparisons** – glucose, insulin, BMI, age, etc.

## 📈 Visual Insights

Key findings visualized include:

- **Age vs Glucose** influence on diabetic outcome
- **BMI Distribution** and its impact
- **Feature correlation heatmap**
- **2D PCA plot** with KMeans clusters and actual outcomes

---

## 💡 Conclusion

This analysis provides a foundation for understanding how various features like glucose levels, BMI, insulin levels, and age contribute to diabetes risk. PCA and clustering reveal meaningful separation between diabetic and non-diabetic cases.
